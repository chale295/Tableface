# Tableface
Hi there! Welcome to TABLEFACE, the virtual version of a party game invented at Haverford College. This README will help you get things up and running.
Note: not sure why some of the text turned pink. You can ignore that.



1. If you haven't already, download the project's "implementation/" folder from GitHub move the folder to the home directory of your CS50 IDE.
    There should be two folders ("static/" and "templates/") within "implementation", along with the two .md files, "application.py",
    and two .json files.


2. Use the cd command to change your working directory to the "implementation/" folder.


3. Execute the command "flask run" and click the https link to enter the site.


4. Once you've entered the site, it should be pretty self-explanatory to use.

    From the home page, begin by clicking "Learn How to Play". This will redirect you to the site's "about" page. Here you'll
    learn what Tableface is and how to play it. Once you're ready, click the "New Game" button, which will redirect you to the "play" page.

    I recommend opening the "play" page in a new tab so you can refer back to the "about" page as necessary - unfortunately, leaving or refreshing
    the "play" page will wipe the board clean and you'll have to redraw everything.


5. Once you're on the "play" page, you can use the "Draw/Erase" selector in the bottom left corner of the screen to draw on the board
    or erase as necessary.

    Following the game directions in "about", press the "FLIP" button when you're ready. This will "flip" a virtual
    bottle cap to a random position on the board (this will make sense after reading the game instructions). Play proceeds as described.

    Again, DO NOT REFRESH the "play" page unless you want to clear the board!!
